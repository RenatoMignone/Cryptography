# Cryptography

This repository contains the code developed for the Cryptography course exercises at Politecnico di Torino.

## Overview

This repository stores implementations of various cryptographic algorithms and techniques in both C and Python, following the course structure:

- **C Programming with OpenSSL**: Implementation of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic primitives, hashes, MACs, and protocols
- **Python Implementations**: Code focusing on cryptographic primitives and security analysis

## Environment Setup

The reference environment for these exercises is:
- Kali Linux 2024.3+
- Python 3 interpreter with required packages
- OpenSSL and OpenSSL development libraries

While other platforms may work, all implementations are tested on the reference environment.

## Resources

Additional resources for this course:
- OpenSSL documentation
- Python cryptography libraries documentation
- Course materials on the official GitHub: [https://github.com/aldobas/cryptography-03lpyov-exercises](https://github.com/aldobas/cryptography-03lpyov-exercises)

## Learning Objectives

This code repository supports the following learning objectives:
- Improving programming skills in cryptography implementation
- Understanding both constructive and analytical approaches to cryptography
- Mapping theoretical concepts into practical implementations
- Developing skills in two key languages for security work:
  - C for high-efficiency and custom solutions
  - Python for security analysis and rapid prototyping
